# Differs

Hi there, thank you for taking an interest in this project.

I started building a CSS framework a while ago. I can't remember when, but on my Mac _Date Modified_ says: **Mar 28, 2017**.

After a couple of weeks, I lost motivation and paused this project for a few months. After a long break, started from scratch as I wanted to make it much better...
As you can guess, lost motivation once again and stopped working on this project entirely. :cry:

I am writing this message into `README` file for now, because I can't really put anything else in it, just yet.
Besides, I'm hoping that by working bits by bits every day will help me stay motivated, especially if people are kind enough to support me and this project by giving it a :star:!

Well, that'd be all for now. Let's see if I can build something to change the future to be brighter and better, than it is now. :pray:
